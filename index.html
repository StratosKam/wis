                    Foo Fighters lovers in Italy who banded together to perform an impressive rendition of the song "Learn to
                    Fly" featuring 1,000 musicians will finally get their wish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lead singer Dave Grohl announced Thursday that the band will play a show on November 3 at the Carisport
                    venue in Cesena -- bringing to reality a dream that organizer Fabio Zaffagnini set in motion last year by
                    putting out a call for hundreds of guitarists, drummers, bassists and singers to perform this summer in
                    unison and film a version of the hit song.

                    Dave Grohl dedicated a song to a little girl with a broken leg at Foo Fighters' concert in Los Angeles
                    earlier this week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grohl himself broke his leg earlier this year, forcing Foo Fighters to cancel their European tour including
                    their headline Glastonbury Festival appearance.

                    Foo Fighters tend to elicit varying emotions amongst music fans. One of them is Anthony, who attended Foo
                    Fighters’ recent gig in Greenwood Village, Colorado and began weeping uncontrollably. Anthony’s tears were
                    prompted by the band’s acoustic rendition of "My Hero".

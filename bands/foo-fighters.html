    <h1>Foo Fighters</h1> is an American rock band, formed in Seattle in 1994. It was founded by Nirvana drummer Dave
    Grohl as a one-man project following the death of Kurt Cobain and the resulting dissolution of his previous band.
    The group got its name from the UFOs and various aerial phenomena that were reported by Allied aircraft pilots in
    World War II, which were known collectively as foo fighters.

    <p>
        Prior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album Foo Fighters, which featured Grohl as the only official
        member, Grohl recruited bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real
        Estate, as well as Nirvana touring guitarist Pat Smear to complete the lineup. The band began with performances
        in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, The Colour and the Shape
        (1997), when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon
        afterward.

        They were replaced by Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, respectively, although Stahl was fired before the
        recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio
        until Chris Shiflett joined as the band's lead guitarist after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose.
        The band released its fourth album, One by One, in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc In
        Your Honor (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth
        album, Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, in 2007. In 2010, it was confirmed that Smear had officially rejoined
        the band after having toured with Foo Fighters as an unofficial member since 2005. The band's seventh studio
        album, Wasting Light, produced by Butch Vig was released in 2011, in which Smear returned as a full member. In
        November 2014, the band's eighth studio album, Sonic Highways, was released as an accompanying soundtrack to the
        Grohl-directed 2014 miniseries of the same name.

    <p>
        Over the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album. As of 2015
        the band's eight albums have sold 12 million copies in the US alone. The band's song "Outside", a single from
        Sonic Highways, reached 11th on Billboard‍ '​s Alternative Songs chart. This marked the Foo Fighters' 30th
        appearance on the chart, tying with Green Day and Red Hot Chili Peppers for third-most appearances.

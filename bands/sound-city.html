            In 1991 Nirvana recorded the album Nevermind at Sound City Studios. Dave Grohl was inspired to create a documentary after he purchased several items from the studio, including the Neve 8028 analog mixing console, when the studio closed in 2011.  Famous musicians who recorded at Sound City reunite at Studio 606 for a jam session and to make an album of "all-new all-original songs, each one composed and recorded exclusively for the film within its own 24-hour session on that console." It also shows album covers by some bands: Red Hot Chili Peppers's One Hot Minute, Nirvana's Incesticide and Nevermind, Rage Against The Machine's self-titled album and many others.

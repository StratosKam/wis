            <p>David Eric "Dave" Grohl (born January 14, 1969) is an American rock musician, multi-instrumentalist,
                singer-songwriter, and producer who is best known as the former drummer for the grunge band Nirvana and
                the founder and frontman of the rock band Foo Fighters, of which he is the main songwriter, lead singer,
                and rhythm guitarist.</p>

            <p>He is also the drummer and co-founder of the rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures. Grohl has
                additionally written all the music and performed all the instruments for his short-lived side projects
                Late! and Probot, as well as being involved with Queens of the Stone Age numerous times throughout the
                past decade.</p>

            <p>He has performed session work (as a drummer) for a variety of musicians, including Garbage, Killing
                Joke, Kristeen Young, Nine Inch Nails, David Bowie, Paul McCartney, The Prodigy, Slash, Iggy Pop,
                Juliette and the Licks, Tenacious D, RDGLDGRN, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Lemmy, Stevie Nicks, Zac
                Brown Band and Ghost.</p>

            <h1>Early life</h1>

            <p>David Eric Grohl was born in Warren, Ohio, the son of Virginia Jean (née Hanlon), a teacher, and James
                Harper Grohl, at the time a newswriter. and he subsequently grew up with his mother.</p>

            <p>At the age of twelve, Grohl began learning to play guitar. He grew tired of lessons and instead taught
                himself, and he eventually began playing in bands with friends.</p>

            <p>In Virginia, Grohl attended Thomas Jefferson High School as a freshman. He was elected vice president of
                his freshman class and in that capacity would manage to play bits of songs by punk bands like Circle
                Jerks and Bad Brains over the school intercom before his morning announcements. Grohl's mother decided
                that he should transfer to Bishop Ireton High School in Alexandria because his cannabis use was
                affecting his grades. He stayed there two years, beginning with a repeat of first year. After his second
                year, he transferred yet again, to Annandale High School.</p>

            <p>While in high school, Grohl played in several local bands, including a stint as guitarist in a band
                called Freak Baby. It was during this period that Grohl taught himself to play drums.</p>

            <p>Many of Grohl's early influences were gained at the 9:30 club, a live music venue in Washington D.C.: "I
                went to the 9:30 club hundreds of times. I was always so excited to get there, and I was always bummed
                when it closed. I spent my teenage years at the club and saw some shows that changed my life".</p>

            <p>Grohl in an interview with The Guardian, "They don't understand that when I was 15 and had Zen Arcade,
                that's when I decided that I loved this music. For me to do anything else for the sole reason of doing
                something different would be so contrived".</p>

            <h1>Scream (1986–1990)</h1>

            <p>At the age of seventeen, Grohl auditioned with local DC favorites Scream to fill the vacancy left by the
                departure of drummer Kent Stax. In order to be considered for the position, Grohl lied about his age,
                claiming he was 20. Over the next four years, Grohl toured extensively with the band, recording a couple
                of live albums (their show of May 4, 1990 in Alzey, Germany being released by Tobby Holzinger as Your
                Choice Live Series Vol.10) and two studio albums, No More Censorship and Fumble, on which Grohl penned
                and sang vocals on the song "Gods Look Down".</p>

            <p>While playing in Scream, Grohl became a fan of Melvins and eventually befriended the band. During a 1990
                tour stop on the West Coast, Melvins' Buzz Osborne took a couple of his friends, Kurt Cobain and Krist
                Novoselic, to see the band.</p>

            <h1>Nirvana (1990–1994)</h1>

            <p>A few months later, Scream unexpectedly disbanded mid-tour following the departure of its bassist Ben
                Pape, who left to join The Four Horsemen. Grohl called Osborne for advice; Osborne informed him that
                Nirvana were looking for a drummer and gave Grohl the phone numbers of Cobain and Novoselic, who
                subsequently invited Grohl to Seattle to audition for Nirvana. Grohl soon joined the band full-time.</p>

            <p>At the time that Grohl joined Nirvana, the band had already recorded several demos for the follow-up to
                their debut album Bleach, having spent time recording with producer Butch Vig in Wisconsin. Initially,
                the plan was to release the album on Sub Pop, but the band received a great deal of interest based on
                the demos. Grohl spent the initial months with Nirvana traveling to various labels as the band shopped
                for a deal, eventually signing with DGC Records. In the spring of 1991, the band entered Sound City
                Studios in Los Angeles to record Nevermind (as seen in Grohl's 2013 documentary Sound City).</p>

            <p>Upon its release, Nevermind exceeded all expectations and became a worldwide commercial success.</p>

            <p>In the later years of Nirvana, Grohl's songwriting contributions increased. In Grohl's initial months in
                Seattle, Cobain overheard him working on a song called "Color Pictures of a Marigold", and the two
                subsequently worked on it together. Grohl would later record the song for the Pocketwatch cassette.
                Grohl stated in a 2014 episode of Sonic Highways that Cobain reacted by kissing him upon first hearing a
                demo of "Alone + Easy Target" that Grohl had recently recorded. During the sessions for In Utero,
                Nirvana decided to re-record "Color Pictures of a Marigold" released this version as a B-side on the
                "Heart-Shaped Box" single, titled simply "Marigold". Grohl also contributed the main guitar riff for
                "Scentless Apprentice". Cobain admitted in a late 1993 MTV interview that he initially thought the riff
                was "kind of boneheaded", but was gratified at how the song developed (a process captured in part in a
                demo on the Nirvana box set With the Lights Out). Cobain noted that he was excited at the possibility of
                having Novoselic and Grohl contribute more to the band's songwriting.</p>

            <p>Prior to their 1994 European tour, the band scheduled session time at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle to
                work on demos. For most of the three-day session, Cobain was absent, so Novoselic and Grohl worked on
                demos of their own songs. The duo completed several of Grohl's songs, including future Foo Fighters
                songs "Exhausted", "Big Me", "February Stars", and "Butterflies". On the third day of the session,
                Cobain finally arrived, and the band recorded a demo of a song later named "You Know You're Right". It
                was the band's final studio recording.</p>

            <h1>Foo Fighters (1994–present)</h1>

            <p>Following Cobain's death in April 1994, Grohl retreated, unsure of where to go and what to do with
                himself. In October 1994, Grohl scheduled studio time, again at Robert Lang Studios, and quickly
                recorded a fifteen-track demo. With the exception of a single guitar part on "X-Static" played by Greg
                Dulli of the Afghan Whigs, Grohl performed all of the instruments himself.</p>

            <p>At the same time, Grohl wondered if his future might be in drumming for other bands. In November, Grohl
                took a brief turn with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, including a performance on Saturday Night Live.
                Petty asked him to join permanently, but Grohl declined.</p>

            <p>After passing the demo around, Grohl found himself with considerable major label interest. Nirvana's A&R
                rep Gary Gersh had subsequently taken over as president of Capitol Records and lured Grohl to sign with
                the label. Grohl did not want the effort to be considered the start of a solo career, so he recruited
                other band members: former Germs and touring Nirvana guitarist Pat Smear and two members of the recently
                disbanded Sunny Day Real Estate, William Goldsmith (drums) and Nate Mendel (bass). Rather than re-record
                the album, Grohl's demo was given a professional mix by Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock and was released in
                July 1995 as Foo Fighters' debut album.</p>

            <p>During a break between tours, the band entered the studio and recorded a cover of Gary Numan's "Down in
                the Park". In February 1996, Grohl and his then-wife Jennifer Youngblood made a brief cameo appearance
                on The X-Files third season episode "Pusher".</p>

            <p>After touring for the self-titled album for more than a year, Grohl returned home and began work on the
                soundtrack to the 1997 movie Touch. Grohl performed all of the instruments and vocals himself, save for
                vocals from Veruca Salt singer Louise Post on the title track, keyboards by Barrett Jones (who also
                co-produced the record) on one track, and vocals and guitar by X's John Doe on "This Loving Thing
                (Lynn's Song)". Grohl completed the recording in two weeks, and immediately joined Foo Fighters to work
                on their follow-up.</p>

            <p>In the midst of the initial sessions for Foo Fighters' second album, tension emerged between Grohl and
                Goldsmith. According to Goldsmith, "Dave had me do 96 takes of one song, and I had to do thirteen hours'
                worth of takes on another one. to Los Angeles to re-record most of the album with Grohl behind the kit.
                After the sessions were complete, Goldsmith officially announced his departure from the band.</p>

            <p>Speaking in 2011 about the tension surrounding the departure of Goldsmith, Grohl explained that "there
                were a lot of reasons it didn't work out, but there was also a part of me that was like, you know, I
                don't know if I'm finished playing the drums yet". He also stated that "I wish that I would have handled
                things differently".</p>

            <p>The effort was released in May 1997 as the band's second album, The Colour and the Shape, which
                eventually cemented Foo Fighters as a staple of rock radio. The album spawned several hits, including
                "Everlong", "My Hero", and "Monkey Wrench". Just prior to the album's release, former Alanis Morissette
                drummer Taylor Hawkins joined the band on drums. The following September, Smear (a close friend of
                Jennifer Youngblood) left the band, and was replaced by touring guitarist Chris Shiflett, who later
                became a full-fledged member during the recording of One by One.</p>

            <p>Grohl's life of non-stop touring and travel continued with Foo Fighters' popularity. During his
                infrequent pauses he lived in Seattle and Los Angeles before returning to Alexandria, Virginia. It was
                there that he turned his basement into a recording studio where the 1999 album There Is Nothing Left to
                Lose was recorded.</p>

            <p>In 2000, the band recruited Queen guitarist Brian May to add some guitar flourish to a cover of Pink
                Floyd's "Have a Cigar", a song which Foo Fighters previously recorded as a b-side. The friendship
                between the two bands resulted in Grohl and Taylor Hawkins being asked to induct Queen into the Rock and
                Roll Hall of Fame in 2001. May later contributed guitar work for the song "Tired of You" on the ensuing
                Foo Fighters album, as well as on an unreleased Foo Fighters song called "Knucklehead".</p>

            <p>Near the end of 2001, Foo Fighters returned to the studio to work on their fourth album. After four
                months in the studio, with the sessions finished, Grohl accepted an invitation to join Queens of the
                Stone Age and helped them to record their 2002 album Songs for the Deaf. (Grohl can be seen drumming for
                the band in the video for the song "No One Knows".) After a brief tour through North America, Britain
                and Japan with the band</p>

            <p>On November 23, 2002, Grohl achieved a historical milestone by replacing himself on the top of the
                Billboard Modern Rock chart, when "You Know You're Right" by Nirvana was replaced by "All My Life" by
                Foo Fighters. When "All My Life" ended its run, after a one-week respite, "No One Knows" by Queens of
                the Stone Age took the number one spot. Between October 26, 2002 and March 1, 2003 Grohl was in the
                number one spot on the Modern Rock charts for 17 of 18 successive weeks, as a member of three different
                groups.</p>

            <p>Grohl and Foo Fighters released their fifth album In Your Honor on June 14, 2005. Prior to starting work
                on the album, the band spent almost a year relocating Grohl's home-based Virginia studio to a brand new
                facility, dubbed Studio 606, located in a warehouse near Los Angeles. Featuring collaborations with John
                Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin, Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age and Norah Jones, the album was a
                departure from previous efforts, and included one rock and one acoustic disc.</p>

            <p>Foo Fighters's sixth studio album Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace was released on September 25, 2007.
                It was recorded during a three-month period between March 2007 and June 2007, and its release was
                preceded by the first single "The Pretender" on September 17. The second single, "Long Road to Ruin",
                was released on December 3, 2007, followed by the third single, "Let It Die", June 24, 2008.</p>

            <p>On November 3, 2009, Foo Fighters released their first Greatest Hits collection, consisting of 16 tracks
                including a previously unreleased acoustic version of "Everlong" and two new tracks "Wheels" and "Word
                Forward" which were produced by Nevermind's producer Butch Vig. Grohl has been quoted saying the
                Greatest Hits is too early and "... can look like an obituary". He does not feel they have written their
                best hits yet.</p>

            <p>The Foo Fighters' seventh studio album, Wasting Light, was released on April 12, 2011. It is the first
                Foo Fighters album to reach No. 1 in the United States. Despite rumors of a hiatus,</p>

            <p>Grohl and the Foo Fighters sometimes perform as cover band "Chevy Metal, "as they did in May 2015 at
                "Conejo Valley Days", a county fair in Thousand Oaks, California.</p>

            <p>On May 19, 2012, the Foo Fighters appeared with Mick Jagger on Saturday Night Live. They performed the
                Jagger/Richards songs "19th Nervous Breakdown" and "It's Only Rock 'n Roll".</p>

            <p>On November 10, 2014, the Foo Fighters released their eighth studio album, "Sonic Highways".</p>

            <p>On June 12, 2015, while playing a show in Gothenburg, Sweden, Grohl fell off the stage breaking his leg.
                He left temporarily and returned with a cast to finish the concert.</p>

            <p>On July 31, 2015, Grohl posted a personal reply to Fabio Zaffagnini, Marco Sabiu, and the 1,000
                participants of the "Rockin' 1000" project in Cesena, Italy, thanking them for their combined
                performance of the Foo Fighters' song "Learn to Fly" from their 1999 album There is Nothing Left to
                Lose, indicating (in broken Italian), "... I promise, we'll</p>

            <h1>Additional projects and contributions</h1>

            <p>Apart from his main bands, Grohl has been involved in other music projects. In 1992, he played drums on
                Buzz Osborne's Kiss-styled solo-EP King Buzzo, where he was credited as Dale Nixon, a pseudonym that
                Greg Ginn adopted to play bass on Black Flag's My War. He also released the music cassette Pocketwatch
                under the pseudonym Late! on the now defunct indie label, Simple Machines.</p>

            <p>In 1993, Grohl was recruited to help recreate the music of The Beatles' early years for the movie
                Backbeat. he played drums in an "all-star" lineup that included Greg Dulli of the Afghan Whigs, indie
                producer Don Fleming, Mike Mills of R.E.M., Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, and Dave Pirner of Soul
                Asylum. A music video was filmed for the song "Money" while Grohl was with Nirvana on their 1994
                European tour, footage of Grohl was filmed later and included.</p>

            <p>Later in 1994, Grohl played drums on two tracks for Mike Watt's Ball-Hog or Tugboat?. In early 1995,
                Grohl and Foo Fighters played their first US tour opening for Watt, and helped make up Watt's supporting
                band. Nicknamed the "Ringspiel" tour, Watt's band featured Grohl and William Goldsmith on drums, Eddie
                Vedder and Pat Smear on guitar, and Watt on bass.</p>

            <p>During the early 2000s, Grohl spent time in his basement studio writing and recording a number of songs
                for a metal project. Over the span of several years, he recruited his favorite metal vocalists from the
                1980s, including Lemmy of Motörhead, Conrad "Cronos" Lant from Venom, King Diamond, Scott Weinrich,
                Snake of Voivod and Max Cavalera of Sepultura, to perform the vocals for the songs. The project was
                released in 2004 under the moniker Probot.</p>

            <p>Also in 2003, Grohl stepped behind the kit to perform on Killing Joke's second self-titled album.</p>

            <p>Grohl lent his drumming skills to other artists during the early 2000s. In 2000, he played drums and sang
                on a track, "Goodbye Lament", from Tony Iommi's album Iommi. In 2001, Grohl performed on Tenacious D's
                debut album, and appeared in the video for lead single "Tribute" as a demon. He later appeared in the
                duo's 2006 movie Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny as the devil in the song "Beelzeboss", and performed
                on its soundtrack. He also performed drums for their 2012 album Rize of the Fenix. In 2002, Grohl helped
                Chan Marshall of Cat Power on the album You Are Free and played with Queens of the Stone Age on their
                album Songs for the Deaf. Grohl also toured with the band in support of the album, delaying work on the
                Foo Fighters' album One by One. In 2004, Grohl drummed on several tracks for Nine Inch Nails' 2005 album
                With Teeth.</p>

            <p>In June 2008, Grohl was Paul McCartney's special guest for a concert at the Anfield football stadium in
                Liverpool, in one of the central events of the English city's year as European Capital of Culture.</p>

            <p>Grohl played drums on the tracks "Run with the Wolves" and "Stand Up" on The Prodigy's 2009 album
                Invaders Must Die.</p>

            <p>In July 2009, it was revealed that Grohl was recording with Josh Homme and John Paul Jones as Them
                Crooked Vultures. The band played their first UK gig on August 26, 2009, with a surprise appearance at
                Brixton Academy in London, supporting the Arctic Monkeys. The band released their debut album Them
                Crooked Vultures on November 16, 2009 in the UK and November 17, 2009 in the US.</p>

            <p>On February 6, 2010, Grohl performed with his band Them Crooked Vultures the songs "Mind Eraser, No
                Chaser" and "New Fang" as musical guests on Saturday Night Live Dave Grohl appeared as an old punk rock
                drummer reuniting the group "Crisis of Conformity" after 25 years in a skit later on in the episode.</p>

            <p>In mid-2010, Dave Grohl added his name to the list of contributing rock star voice cameos for Cartoon
                Network's heavy metal parody/tribute show, Metalocalypse. He voiced the controversial Syrian dictator,
                Abdule Malik in the season 3 finale, Doublebookedklok.</p>

            <p>On October 23, 2010, Grohl performed with Tenacious D at Blizzcon. He appeared as the drummer for the
                entire concert, and a year later he returned with Foo Fighters and played another set there, this time
                as guitarist and vocalist.</p>

            <p>Also in 2010, Grohl helped write and performed on drums for "Watch This" with guitarist Slash and Duff
                McKagan on Slash's self-titled album that also included many other famous artists.</p>

            <p>In October 2011, Grohl temporarily joined Cage the Elephant as a replacement on tour after drummer Jared
                Champion's appendix burst.</p>

            <p>Grohl directed a documentary entitled Sound City which is about the Van Nuys studio of the same name
                where Nevermind was recorded that shut down its music operations in 2011.</p>

            <p>On November 6, 2012, following the departure of Joey Castillo from Queens of the Stone Age, Grohl has
                been confirmed as the drummer for the band on the upcoming album.</p>

            <p>At the 12-12-12 Sandy benefit concert Paul McCartney joined Grohl and the surviving members of Nirvana
                (Krist Novoselic and touring guitarist Pat Smear) to perform "Cut Me Some Slack", a song later recorded
                for the Sound City soundtrack.</p>

            <p>In February 2013, Grohl filled in as host of Chelsea Lately for a week. Guests included Elton John, who
                disclosed on the E! show that he would appear with Grohl on the next Queens of the Stone Age album.
                Grohl had previously hosted the show during the first week of December 2012 as part of "Celebrity Guest
                Host Week".</p>

            <p>Grohl delivered a keynote speech at the 2013 SXSW conference in Austin Texas, US on the morning of March
                14. Lasting just under an hour, the speech covered Grohl's musical life from his youth through to his
                role with the Foo Fighters and emphasized the importance of each individual's voice, regardless of who
                the individual is: "There is no right or wrong—there is only your voice... What matters most is that
                it’s your voice. Cherish it. Respect it. Nurture it. Challenge it. Respect it". Grohl also admitted
                during the speech that Psy's "Gangnam Style" was one of his favorite songs of "the past decade". He also
                referenced Edgar Winter's instrumental "Frankenstein" as being the song that made him want to become a
                musician.</p>

            <p>On November 6, 2013, Dave Grohl played drums at the 2013 CMA awards replacing drummer Chris Fryar for
                Country Music band Zac Brown Band. The band debuted their new song "Day for the Dead".</p>

            <p>Dave Grohl also featured on drums for new indie hip hop band RDGLDGRN. He worked with them closely on
                their EP. The group asked fellow Northern Virginia native Dave Grohl, who was filming his Sound City
                documentary, to drum on "I Love Lamp." Grohl agreed and played drums for the entire record, with the
                exception of "Million Fans", which features a sampled breakbeat.</p>

            <p>Grohl, a fan of the theatrical Swedish metal band Ghost (also known as Ghost B.C. especially in America)
                produced their album If You Have Ghost. He was also featured in a number of songs on the album. Grohl
                played rhythm guitar for the song If You Have Ghosts (a cover of a Roky Erickson song), and drums on I'm
                a Marionette (an ABBA cover) as well as Waiting for the Night (a Depeche Mode cover). According to a
                member of Ghost, Grohl has appeared live in concert with the band wearing the same identity concealing
                outfit that the rest of the band usually wears.</p>

            <p>On May 20, 2015, David Letterman selected Grohl and The Foo Fighters to play "Everlong" as the last
                musical guest on the final episode of The Late Show with David Letterman. Letterman stated that he
                considered "Everlong" to be his favorite song and that he and the band were "joined at the hip" ever
                since the band canceled tour dates to play his first show back from heart bypass surgery at his
                request.</p>

            <p>In September, the all-star covers album by the Alice Cooper-led Hollywood Vampires supergroup was
                released and features Grohl playing drums on the medley "One/Jump Into The Fire".</p>

            <h1>Personal life</h1>

            <p>Grohl has been married twice. He was married to photographer Jennifer Youngblood from 1994 to 1997. On
                August 2, 2003, Grohl married Jordyn Blum and together they have three daughters: Violet Maye (born
                April 15, 2006), Harper Willow (born April 17, 2009), and Ophelia Saint (born August 1, 2014).</p>

            <p>Grohl has been vocal in his views on drug misuse, contributing to a 2009 anti-drug video for the BBC. "I
                have never done cocaine, ever in my life. I have never done heroin, I have never done speed," he said in
                a 2008 interview, adding that he had stopped smoking cannabis and taking LSD at the age of 20. In the
                BBC video he said, "I've seen people die. It ain't easy being young, but that stuff doesn't make it any
                easier".</p>

            <p>In May 2006, Grohl sent a note of support to the two trapped miners in the Beaconsfield mine collapse in
                Tasmania, Australia. In the initial days following the collapse, one of the men requested an iPod with
                Foo Fighters album In Your Honor, to be sent down to them through a small hole. Grohl's note read, in
                part, "Though I'm halfway around the world right now, my heart is with you both, and I want you to know
                that when you come home, there's two tickets to any Foos show, anywhere, and two cold beers waiting for
                yous. Deal?" The song, titled "Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners," appears on Foo Fighters' 2007 release
                Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, and features Kaki King.</p>

            <p>Grohl is an advocate for LGBT rights. He has worn a White Knot ribbon to various events to promote
                whiteknot.org. When questioned about the knot, he responded "You know what that's about? I believe in
                love and I believe in equality and I believe in marriage equality." The ballot measure was ultimately
                defeated on November 3, 1992.</p>

            <p>Grohl dropped out of high school in the beginning of the 11th grade. He still does not know how to read
                sheet music and writes his music only by ear.</p>

            <p>Grohl is a Democrat and supporter of President Barack Obama, and performed "My Hero" in September at the
                2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>

            <p>In August 2009, Grohl was given the key to the city of Warren, Ohio and performed the songs "Everlong",
                "Times Like These", and "My Hero". A roadway in downtown Warren named "David Grohl Alley" has been
                dedicated to him with murals by local artists.</p>

            <p>In 2000, while on tour with Foo Fighters in Australia, Grohl was arrested by Australian police while
                driving a scooter for driving under the influence following a concert on the Gold Coast in Queensland.
                He was fined $400 and had his Australian driving permit revoked for three months. Following the incident
                Grohl stated: "So, people, I guess if there's anything to learn here, it's: don't drive after a few
                beers, even if you feel entirely capable like I did".</p>

            <p>Dave Grohl's hometown of Warren, Ohio unveiled gigantic 902 lb (409 kg) drumsticks in 2012 to honor him.
                According to the Hollywood Reporter, the massive pair have broken the Guinness World Record.</p>

            <p>In 2012, Grohl was estimated to be the third wealthiest drummer in the world, behind Ringo Starr and Phil
                Collins, with a fortune of $225 million.</p>

            <p>On November 11, 2014 Grohl joined Bruce Springsteen and Zac Brown on stage at the Concert for Valor in
                Washington, D.C. to support U.S. troops and veterans.</p>

            <p>Grohl's first solo-Rolling Stone Magazine cover story appeared on December 4, 2014.</p>

            Foo Fighters tend to elicit varying emotions amongst music fans. One of them is Anthony, who attended Foo
            Fighters’ recent gig in Greenwood Village, Colorado and began weeping uncontrollably. Anthony’s tears were
            prompted by the band’s acoustic rendition of "My Hero".

            "Don’t cry motherfucker, I know you’re drunk, don’t cry," Grohl said halfway through the performance. "Are
            you crying right now? You’re fucking crying aren’t you? (Laughs) I love you man, look at you, holy shit.
            You know what, fuck that speech I was just going to make, I’m singing this shit to you right now. I’m gonna
            sing this fucking song right in your face, man to man, prison style, I’m going man to man. Me and you, I
            want some real tears, you better sing it with me. (Laughs) Don’t make me cry, because I promised I wouldn’t
            do this."

            A person claiming to be Anthony called into KBCO-FM on Tuesday. He explained his mother recently died and he
            had just gotten back from Europe after putting her in a crypt. He also said he was not drunk, but did smoke
            marijuana beforehand.

            "Holy shit, that’s actually my doctor. What a badass!" That was what Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl had
            to say after his orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Lew Schon, performed the White Stripes' "Seven Nation Army"
            onstage with the Foos during their July 19 show at Boston’s Fenway Park. Dr. Lew not only impressed Grohl,
            but his rousing performance (which you can watch above) had the crowd yelling "Lew," in a way similar to
            Bruce Springsteen fans adoringly yell "Bruce."

            Before the song began, Grohl told those in attendance how Dr. Lew came to be onstage with them that night.
            "My orthopedic doctor is here tonight okay," explained Grohl. "The man that made it possible for me to get
            onstage and play a show tonight. Now, he came to my hotel room today and he f–king checked out my leg and
            he said, ‘You can rock Fenway tonight’ and I said, ‘Lou, so can you.'"

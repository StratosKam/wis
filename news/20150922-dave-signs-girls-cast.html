            Dave dedicated a song to a little girl with a broken leg at Foo Fighters' concert in Los Angeles earlier this
            week. Dave himself broke his leg earlier this year, forcing Foo Fighters to cancel their European tour
            including their headline Glastonbury Festival appearance.

            During the band's show at The Forum on Tuesday (September 22), Dave spotted an injured young fan in the
            audience. Dedicating 'Big Me' to the fan, Dave said, "This one, I usually dedicate to the road crew, and
            the people who built the throne, and all that bullshit... [but] I’m going to sing this one for the little
            lady who broke her leg too, how bout that?"

            Asking the girl how she broke her leg, he added, "In the pool! What?! Man! Can I sign your cast?
            Will you sign mine too? This one goes out to you. I can’t [sign] it now, I’m on the clock. I’m going
            to get it later. This is an old song I’m going to sing for the little lady with the broken leg, because
            nobody wants a fuckin’ broken leg man!," he continued before launching into 'Big Me'. Dave returned to the
            girl at the end of the set to sign her cast.

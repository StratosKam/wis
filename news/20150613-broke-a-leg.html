            It takes a special kind of commitment to keep entertaining a crowd of thousands on a freshly-broken leg,
            but Dave is dedicated to his fans. He took a catastrophic tumble off the stage
            during a concert in Gothenburg, Sweden on Friday, forcing him into a surprisingly brief hiatus to seek
            medical assistance.

            Two songs into the band's show at Ullevi stadium, Grohl seemed to have miscalculated a jump onto a ramp,
            falling instead into the security pit. "I think I just broke my leg," he announced to the crowd while
            lying on the ground, as captured by a fan video. "I think I really broke my leg!" To any audience members
            making the reasonable assumption that the show was over for the night, he offered some reassurance.
            "You have my promise right now that the Foo Fighters, we're gonna come back and finish this show,"
            he said. "But right now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna go to the hospital, I'm gonna fix my leg.
            But then I'm gonna come back, and we're gonna play for you again! I'm so sorry!"

            He then handed the show over to drummer Taylor Hawkins, who led the band in a set of covers in Grohl's
            absence. About an hour later, Grohl returned to the stage on a stretcher, with the assistance of two
            medics. They set him down on a chair, from which he proceeded to rock for another two-and-a-half hours.

            Unfortunately, the injury has forced the band to cancel their appearance at the Pinkpop
            Festival(June 14th), their show at the AFG Arena in St. Gallen (June 16th),two shows at London's
            Wembley Stadium (June 19th and 20th), Edinburgh's BT Murrayfield Stadium (June 23th), Werchter,
            Belgium's Festivalpark Werchter (June 25th) and Glastonbury (June 26th).

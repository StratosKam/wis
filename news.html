            Foo Fighters lovers in Italy who banded together to perform an impressive rendition of the song "Learn to
            Fly" featuring 1,000 musicians will finally get their wish.
        </p>

            Lead singer Dave Grohl announced Thursday that the band will play a show on November 3 at the Carisport
            venue in Cesena -- bringing to reality a dream that organizer Fabio Zaffagnini set in motion last year by
            putting out a call for hundreds of guitarists, drummers, bassists and singers to perform this summer in
            unison and film a version of the hit song.

            Dave Grohl dedicated a song to a little girl with a broken leg at Foo Fighters' concert in Los Angeles
            earlier this week.
        </p>
        <p>
            Grohl himself broke his leg earlier this year, forcing Foo Fighters to cancel their European tour including
            their headline Glastonbury Festival appearance.

            Foo Fighters tend to elicit varying emotions amongst music fans. One of them is Anthony, who attended Foo
            Fighters’ recent gig in Greenwood Village, Colorado and began weeping uncontrollably. Anthony’s tears were
            prompted by the band’s acoustic rendition of "My Hero".

            "Holy shit, that’s actually my doctor. What a badass!" That was what Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl had
            to say after his orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Lew Schon, performed the White Stripes‘ "Seven Nation Army"
            onstage with the Foos during their July 19 show at Boston’s Fenway Park.

            It takes a special kind of commitment to keep entertaining a crowd of thousands on a freshly-broken leg,
            but Dave is dedicated to his fans. He took a catastrophic tumble off the stage
            during a concert in Gothenburg, Sweden on Friday, forcing him into a surprisingly brief hiatus to seek
            medical assistance.
